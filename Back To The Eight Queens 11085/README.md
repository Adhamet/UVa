The first solution "11085.cpp": is a dp & recursion/back-tracking solution.
it's a simple 8 queens problem where probabilities are previously stored. The only idea here is the calculation of minimum differences between the current row and all correct rows. If you're going to pick a solution you're gonna have to pick it all for the rest of the calculation.
